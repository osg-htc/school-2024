Learn how this summer at the lovely University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Applications are now open! See below for details. During the School, August 5\u20139 , you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems \u2014 at your own campus or using the national-scale Open Science Pool \u2014 to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today\u2019s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and lots of hands-on activities with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to get more information and help. The school is ideal for: Researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process; Anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers who are current or potential users of high-throughput computing; Instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum. People accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School. Applications \u00b6 Applications are now open. The deadline for applications is Monday, 1 April 2024. Submit your application by then to ensure consideration! To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like): Complete the online application form (the link goes to a Qualtrics survey, which is the application) Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to school@osg-htc.org (ideally PDF or plain text) For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally \u2014 ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and the \u201cOSG School 2024\u201d in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter. Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG School is part of the OSG Outreach Area \u2014 please visit that site to learn about other OSG Outreach activities.
