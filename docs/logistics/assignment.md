# OSG School 2024 Assignment

The School focused on using high-throughput computing (HTC) to support and transform research.
Your final assignment lets you show what you learned and how you might apply your new abilities.
We ask for it to:

-   Reinforce and consolidate what you learned at the School
-   Prepare you to take real action on your large-scale computational challenge(s)
-   Demonstrate the value of the School to our funding agencies and to your advisor, colleagues, etc.
-   Guide us as we try to improve the School

## Option 1: Lightning Talk on Last Day of School

<span style="color: #FF6600; font-weight: bold;">If you did a lightning talk on Friday, August 9,</span>
it was your final assignment and you are done.

## Option 2: Short Write-Up

For most people, the assignment is a short write-up.
This is not a formal paper, report, essay, or anything like that.
We will not publish your write-up&nbsp;&mdash; it is just between you and us.

### Content guidelines

For the content, think of a written version of a lightning talk:

1.  Describe your science for a broad audience in 1 paragraph to 1 page (this is a good life skill!)
1.  Describe one computing challenge that you want to work on (also 1 paragraph to 1 page)
1.  Explain your plan to work on that challenge with the new things you learned at the School (probably a whole page)

For the last part, your audience is the School staff,
so you do not have to re-explain concepts and methods that we explained here.
Instead, write about how you will apply those things!

You are welcome to dive into details (like resource needs, etc.),
but be sure to start with the high-level plan so we understand the context.

Be sure to put most of your effort into the third part, the plan.
If you paste in three pages of intro from another paper,
and then write one paragraph about your plan,
we will probably ask for more details on the plan!

### Format guidelines

-   Write at least a full page and **no more** than four pages of text (single-spaced)
-   Add images, tables, or figures if you like; they may cause your total page count to go over four pages
-   Do not take time to add citations, references, etc.
-   Email your write-up as a PDF (only!) to the <school@osg-htc.org> list

### Deadline

The paper is due 20 September 2024.
Contact us early if you need an extension.
