# Travel Advice

This page offers some tips for traveling to and from the OSG School.

When travelling, you may experience delays, changes, or cancellations
due to weather, mechanical issues, and so on.
It is good to be prepared for last-minute changes.
Below are some tips and ideas for dealing with travel.

For health guidelines, before or during the event, please see our [health guidelines page](../health.md).

## Checking In Early

Airlines generally allow you to check in for your flights the day before.
Doing so may save you time and hassle at the airport.
Go to your airline website and look for the “Check In” section, then follow the steps.

## Finding Flight Status

Be sure to check your flight status often, starting the day before travel begins.
While you can check the status of each flight individually on the airline website (or a third-party site),
you may be able to view your entire trip at once. 

Go to your airline website, find their section for “My Trips” or something similar,
and use the six-character “Confirmation Number” on your itinerary 
plus your last name to access your full itinerary,
including flight status for each segment.

Definitely check your flight status before leaving for the airport!

## If Your Arrival in Madison Is Delayed

If your flights change and you will arrive in Madison later than planned,
think about what effect that will have:

*   If you will arrive before Sunday, 6 p.m. (or so), you should be fine.
    If there is time, you can still go to the hotel first; if it is after 5:30 p.m. (or so),
    it may be best to go straight to the Fluno Center for the welcome dinner at 6:30 p.m.

*   If you will arrive on Sunday but after 6 p.m. (or so), you will miss the welcome dinner.
    Go straight to the hotel and check in, then find dinner on your own; we can reimburse you in this case.
    Try to let us know about the situation, when you can.

*   If you will arrive later than Sunday, just do your best to get here.
    Try to let us know about your situation as soon as you can.
    We can help deal things like the hotel and may be able to suggest travel options.

If you need to make flight changes, see below.

## If Your Arrival Back Home Is Delayed

If you flights back home are delayed, there is not as much that we can do.
For example, it is not clear whether we can pay for changes on return flights.
Contact your airline to find out how they will get you home.

## If You Must Make Flight Changes

If one or more flights are cancelled,
or **if we approve flight changes and their fees in advance**,
you will need to make new plans with your airline.

If you are at an airport,
it is a good idea to get in line at your airline’s service counter right away.
Also, you can try calling their service number while waiting in line!

For any change that requires extra payment,
**you must get our approval and make the change through Fox World Travel**,
UW–Madison’s only approved travel agency.
If you pay for a change any other way, we cannot reimburse you.

**Fox World Travel phone number:** +1 (844) 630-3853

**Note:** If you call Fox World Travel on the weekend or outside of 7am–7:30pm (Central),
they will charge us $20 just for calling.
So please use this option only when you must pay for approved flight changes.

If there are significant changes to your travel plans,
when you have time,
please [email us](mailto:school@opensciencegrid.org) with your news or reach out to us on Slack.
