# Dining

The School provides [some catered meals](meals.md) as a group,
and you are on your own for others.

When on your own,
there are many dining options in Madison between the School and your hotel,
especially on State Street which is only blocks away from both locations.

Restaurants right on and very near to the Capitol Square, onto which the hotel faces,
tend to be a little more expensive.
As you go toward campus on State Street or neighboring streets, prices tend to go down.
But of course, there are exceptions in both directions!
It is reasonable to ask to see a menu before ordering or being seated and decide whether to stay.
