# Local Transportation

You are responsible for your own transportation within Madison, but we will help
coordinate and can reimburse costs between the airport and your hotel.

## Travel Between the Madison Airport and Your Hotel

For travel between the Madison airport (Dane County Regional Airport) and the [School hotel](hotel.md),
the best option is the hotel shuttle service, when available.
Otherwise, you may use a ride-sharing service or taxi.
See below for details.

<span style="color: #FF6600;">We will help organize groups</span> to take shuttles and taxis,
based on arrival and departure times.
Shuttle/taxi groups will be formed and emailed shortly before the School itself.

## Travel Between the Hotel and Campus

For travel between the [School hotel](hotel.md) and [the Computer Sciences building](location.md) on campus,
walking is a great option.
Also, the hotel shuttle service may be available, especially if organized in advance.
See below for details.

## Options for Getting Around

### Hotel Shuttle

The [Park Hotel](hotel.md) operates a free shuttle service.
The shuttle **may not be available** at all times, though, and it is best to plan ahead.
Work with the hotel staff, individually or even better in groups, to use the shuttle.
As noted above, we will help organize groups for the shuttle for airport arrivals on Sunday and departures on Saturday.

To ask about the shuttle, either stop by the front desk of the hotel,
or call +1&nbsp;(608)&nbsp;285-8000 and press 0 for the front desk.
Explain that you are a guest at the hotel and ask if the shuttle is available for the number of people in your group;
be clear about where you want to go from and to and at what time.

We will send the hotel our list of groups who would like the shuttle for airport trips,
but it is still best for the leader of each group to check with the hotel anyway.

### Walking

It is easy to walk in and around the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison campus,
with many Madison landmarks within a mile of the School and your hotel.
Use a mapping app or ask us or your hotel for a map.
In particular, State Street&nbsp;&mdash; which connects the Capitol Square with the UW campus&nbsp;&mdash;
is full of great restaurants and shops and is worth walking along while you are here.

### City of Madison Metro Bus Service

Many [Madison Metro](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro) buses stop near the hotel and
pass through the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison campus.
Bus fare is $2.00, and if using a transfer ask the driver for a free transfer pass upon boarding.

[Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) is a great resource for finding the best bus routes to use in Madison,
giving multiple route options for each trip.
Additionally, the [Madison Metro Website](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/routes-schedules)
provides a web interface to plan your trip.

!!! note 
    Bus routes stop running around ~11pm each day.

### Taxis and Ride-Sharing Services

Both [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) and [Uber](https://www.uber.com/ride/) are active in Madison,
or you can choose from our local taxi companies, such as
[Madison Taxi](https://www.madtaxi.com) and
[Union Cab](https://www.unioncab.com/).
We cannot recommend any particular option, but those are some options we know about.

!!! note 
    We cannot reimburse for any taxi or rideshare service beyond the ride to and from the airport.

!!! note
    We will need receipts for any ride-share or taxi fare over $25.

### Madison BCycle

Madison is a great city to bike in,
and there is even a short-term bike rental system called [BCycle](https://madison.bcycle.com).
Bcycles are available [throughout the city](https://madison.bcycle.com/nav/map),
including near the hotel and around campus.

Pricing for Bcycles can be found on their 
[website](https://madison.bcycle.com/nav/Join-now) and consist of several tiers.
